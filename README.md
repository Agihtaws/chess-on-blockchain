## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher)
- MetaMask extension installed in your browser
- Somnia Testnet tokens (for contract deployment)

### Installation

#### Smart Contract Deployment
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Agihtaws/chess-on-blockchain.git
cd chess-on-blockchain
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
SOMNIA_TESTNET_URL=https://rpc.ankr.com/somnia_testnet
```

4. Compile and deploy the contract:
```
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network somnia_testnet
```

5. Note the deployed contract address for frontend configuration.

#### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```
cd chess-on-chain-frontend
```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Update the contract address and ABI in `App.js` with your deployed contract information.

4. Start the development server:
```
npm start
```

5. For production deployment:
```
npm run dev
```

### Getting Somnia Testnet Tokens
If you need testnet tokens to deploy the contract:
- Visit the [Somnia Testnet Faucet](https://testnet.somnia.network/)
- Join the [Somnia Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1209923224620761088/1306988055135256738) for support

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Connect your MetaMask wallet to Somnia Testnet
2. Register as a player (one-time transaction)
3. Select a difficulty level
4. Start a new game
5. Make your moves by selecting and moving pieces
6. Game results are automatically recorded on the blockchain

You can also try the game through the [live demo](https://chess-on-blockchain.vercel.app/) without deploying your own version.
